Take Command Console Plugin created with PureBasic

This is my attempt to create a Plugin for Take Command Console using PureBasic.

Thanks to Mijikai at https://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=77805 I now have working PureBasic source code for a 64-bit TCC Plugin.

I've also posted the PureBasic source code, and a working 64-bit plugin dll, at https://jpsoft.com/forums/threads/64-bit-plugin-development-using-purebasic.10988/post-61866
